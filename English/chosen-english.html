                  <p>Kolleti Lake is a tranquil body of water, and on its shores lies the village of Ingilipakalanka. In this village lived a couple, Mudraboina Venkateswara Rao and Ravulamma. They had two sons and two daughters and were a humble family. In those days, due to a lack of medical facilities, cholera outbreaks were common, leaving many children orphaned. Despite their struggles, the couple lovingly raised the children who had lost their parents, ensuring they never felt the pain of growing up without parents.</p>

                  <p>I was born as the youngest son in this family. At my birth, gurus were invited to perform Yajnahom, a sacred ritual, and I was named Veerabrahman according to tradition. Even in childhood, I displayed remarkable wisdom. I often used my intelligence to escape from studies. Surprisingly, the words I spoke in my childhood often came true. Though my parents were devoted idol worshippers, my heart never resonated with idolatry. Yet, out of tradition, I participated in their practices.</p>

                  <p>Life in Kolleti was difficult. Farming was challenging due to unpredictable water levels. During the rice-sweeping season, there would be no water, but during harvest, floods would submerge the entire Kolleru region. Amid these hardships, my mother fell seriously ill. Despite visiting numerous hospitals and spending a fortune on treatments, her condition only worsened. My parents faithfully worshipped their gods, hoping for a miracle, but to no avail. As time passed, her illness became more severe. One day, a passerby told my mother, "If you put your faith in the Lord, your disease will be healed." Desperate for relief, she accepted the Lord as her Savior. Through this faith, she found peace and transformation. Our home became a place of fellowship and hope. The servants of God were invited to pray through fasting. They preached the Word of God, and my family sent them away with joy. My mother suffered from this illness for twelve long years, but her faith in the Lord remained steadfast.</p>

                  <p>I was a student living in a hostel, far from home. The thought of my mother often brought me to tears, and a deep sadness always flowed within me. One night, after crying myself to sleep over thoughts of her, I had a dream. In this dream, my mother had passed away. She was placed in a coffin according to Christian customs, and as they carried her to the grave, I ran after them, screaming and crying.From the coffin being carried, she sat up and said, 'My child, do not weep. The Lord has called me, and so I must go. He will be with you, so be strong and do not grieve." I woke up in a panic, drenched in sweat and tears. That very night, I rushed home, covering six kilometers to reach my mother. I told her about the dream, and we both wept together until morning. The next day, I returned to the hostel.</p>

                  <p>A few days later, as I was climbing the stairs to my classroom, a wave of overwhelming sadness hit me. My books slipped from my hands, and I broke down in tears. Tearfully, I asked the children from my village how my mother was doing. They replied, Everyone from the village is gathered near your house. In my heart, I felt that the reason for my sorrow was the thought that something was wrong with my mother. During the first period, my teacher noticed my distress and sent a friend to where I was standing outside. As we both hurried toward our village, I realized that my mother’s brother, Bungayya, was coming toward me. Tears streaming down his face, he asked, 'Are you coming with me?' He took a few steps forward, then turned back and walked away, and In that moment, I realized something had happened to my mother. By then, they had laid my mother to rest, her life gone. Everyone around wept bitterly. Witnessing that sight, my heart shattered into fragments.Unable to hold back my grief, I collapsed and wept uncontrollably. Her eyes opened briefly, tears streaming down her cheeks, and she took one last look at me before closing them forever. The entire village wept with me, knowing that a mother's love is eternal, even in death. Her funeral was conducted according to Christian rites, and as soon as it ended,a fierce rainstorm and tempest began. I sobbed uncountablly, fearing that even in death, my mother would be caught in the strom but everyone eventually left, and I was left alone in my grief.</p>

                  <p>The loss of my mother's love left a storm of pain within me, tearing my small world apart. Hatred and bitterness were all that remained in my life. In a whisper no one could hear, I cursed Jesus, denying His divinity. Ten days later, I returned to the hostel, still drowning in sorrow. My friends, upon hearing about my mother’s death, tried to comfort me. Everyone showed me kindness, but I was inconsolable. I often recalled the words my mother had spoken in my dream and thought about how much she had loved me. Nights were the hardest; I would cry alone, unable to sleep, consumed by grief.</p>

                  <p>My friends, who were not the best influence, began taking me to the fields instead of school, teaching me to smoke cigarettes. At night, they took me to the movies. Conflicts were a frequent occurrence in the hostel. Whenever someone got hurt, their parents would come to comfort them. But I had no one. No matter how much I am hurt, how much I bleed, or even if I have a fever, there is no one for me to confide in. There’s no mother here—whom do I call ‘Mother’? If my mother were alive, she would have cherished me too. In the quiet of the night, I would sneak into the alley nearby and weep until late, longing for her warmth and the comfort of her embrace.  . Losing the one person I loved most—my mother—left me empty. Love faded from my heart, replaced by anger, hatred, envy, and a desire for revenge.</p>

                  <p>When it came to standing against injustice, I was someone who wouldn’t even hesitate to risk my life. If someone made a girl cry, my friends and I would confront them. I never hesitated to get involved, even in matters that were not my own. Hundreds of friends stood by me to do good, yet even when I was alone, I fearlessly faced bullies and wrongdoers—without realizing that, in the eyes of our righteous God, such actions were like filthy rags.Academically, I was careless. I rarely attended classes and had a reputation as a troublemaker in college. Watching six movies a day became my routine and then return to my room . I would leave my room early in the morning for a 7 AM show, followed by 11 AM, matinee, first, second, and even midnight screenings. Sundays were spent at the beach with friends. After two years, I returned to my hometown and became involved in village politics. I started gathering people on my side, stepping into a different kind of influence.</p>

                  <p>A cruel troublemaker had been tormenting women who ventured outside the village, treating them with extreme brutality. No one had the courage or strength to confront him, and the villagers, crushed by his cruelty, came to me seeking help. They shared their pain and requested me to teach him a lesson. They dressed me in women's clothing and sent me outside the village after sunset, while they watched from a distance. As I stood alone, the troublemaker approached and grabbed my hand. At that moment, every fiber of my being filled with rage, and with all my strength, I struck him down. He collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain and fear, before scrambling to his feet and fleeing into the village, where he fell unconscious. I removed my disguise, changed back into my clothes, and approached him. Trembling, he begged, 'Why are you here? Leave me alone,' and told me to go away.</p>

                  <p>Once, when I came home for summer vacation, I found the house empty, with no one around. Stricken by a gust of wind and faint with hunger, I lie upon the bed. With no one to care for me or provide food, I fall asleep overwhelmed by despair. Around 2 PM, my father came home, saw my condition, and, with a heavy heart, cooked food and handed me. While my mother was alive, my relatives were somewhat supportive. However, after her passing, I was left without any care or support, to the point where I couldn't even cook for myself. Overcome with sorrow, I left the village in tears and reached my elder sister's house in Tenali Patnam. My sister and brother-in-law cared for me more than they did for her own children. After the holidays, when returning to my village, I would stand at the train door, tears streaming down my face, remembering my sister as I reached home. Due to our family's situation, there was no one to cook at home, so they arranged my elder brother's marriage. No matter how short-tempered, mischievous, or arrogant I was—no matter how many quarrels I caused in the village—my sister-in-law cared for me more than her own children, raising me like my own mother.</p>

                  <p>I am someone who, along with my companions, fearlessly steps forward to confront any number of people, regardless of whether they are strangers or kin, in order to fight against injustice and uphold justice. Many times, I risked my life to oppose the corruption, bribery, and wrongful actions that turned justice into injustice in our village. In such situations, a few like-minded individuals, who could not tolerate the growing injustice, greed, and corruption, joined me. Together, we vowed to stand against these wrongdoers and establish true justice in our region.A wealthy merchant who knew us well provided two rifles and several bullets, storing them securely in his house. He encouraged us, saying, "If you want the land to be safe, you must punish these corrupt people without fail." He made us swear an oath and gave us instructions on how to use the weapons. He warned us, "Do not hesitate. Do not count your lives. Fight without fear."At that time, I was just 19 years old, while the others were older than me.</p>

                  <p>During those days, prayer gatherings were being organized in our village. The village pastor and community leaders came to invite me and spoke to me, saying:"Babu, your mother had great faith in the Lord Jesus. She worshiped Him wholeheartedly and has now entered the kingdom of God. We would love for you to attend these gatherings, listen to God's word, and receive His blessings. If you tell us that you will come, we will leave assured."I told them, "Yes, I will come."However, in my heart, I had no real intention of attending. After hearing my words, they left.</p>

                  <p>The prayer gatherings began. The next morning, he came again and asked, “Babu, you said you would come to the meeting today. Are you coming?”I couldn’t go back on my word, so I went. The evangelist were preaching, sharing divine wisdom. “Brother, be careful. "If you are planning to do something to someone, God is going to do something to you."He pointed directly at me as he spoke.Hearing his words, I became very angry. "Are they insulting me like this just to make me attend the gatherings? I wanted to see their end."But as he continued speaking , the evangelist pointed at me and said, “If you obey God, He will make you greater than me.” In my heart, I thought, 'He doesn’t even know about my bad habits. I have tried many times to quit smoking, but I couldn’t. I used to crush the cigarette pack and throw it away, only to buy another one and smoke again .Because of the Jaraada Killis, even though my cheeks have been slapped repeatedly, I cannot stop it. In my heart, I am thinking that what He says is a complete lie. On a sudden, then he said, “What I am telling you is true. Believe my words—God will transform you this very day.' As he preached these words, they deeply touched my heart, and I liked them very much."He also assured, “God will speak to you.”After the gathering ended, I started walking away but suddenly stopped and turned back to look at the servant of God. I wondered, 'If I share everything about my life with him, maybe he will show me a way to change before my life is completely ruined.' Thinking this, I looked toward him. But I hesitated—there were so many people around him."They are all devotees," I thought, "and I am not like them. I don't belong here."Just as I was about to walk away, he suddenly called out, “Hey, brother, come here!I turned around, unsure if he was talking to me. I looked around to see if he meant someone else. But he looked directly at me and said again, “Yes, you—come here.”So, I went to him. Everyone is offering their praises to Him. I used to consider bowing with both hands as a shame, but since everyone was doing it, I also saluted with both hands. He then spoke to me and asked, "Will you come to Nujividu and have a repentance?" I replied, "I will come and change my heart." Then he said, "Why do you come? You will slip away like Channa punctata fish." I felt deeply insulted and thought, "How can he speak to me like this?" Filled with anger, I went home.</p>

                  <p>According to the agreement I had made, my group members came to call me. But my elder brother saw them and, feeling displeased, told them to leave. So, they left. That night, I could not sleep. The words spoken by evangelist echoed in my ears repeatedly, as if they were greeting me over and over again my eyes. Their voices played in my mind, making me restless. Finally, I decided: "No matter what, I must go and have a repentance."As planned, I woke up early in the morning and set out on my journey. Just then, my father arrived from Tenali and asked, "Where have you traveled to?" I replied, "I am going because evangelist has asked me to come and have a repentance.I said, "Maybe I will change". Hearing this, my father responded, Instead of talking crazy, remember that you have dug a seven-acre pond and spent seventy thousand rupees, saying you will take care of it.So you cannot go anywhere.  I firmly replied, "If I don’t go, neither you, I, nor our property will remain be careful! May be I will change." Immediately, my father gave me money and sent me away.On the second day, I arrived and was admitted to ITI. Soon after, I began fasting and praying for my transformation. I confessed every sin before God, hoping for a divine encounter. But God did not speak to me. I did not have transformation. I started thinking: "This is all just deception. They are fooling people."With this in my mind, I went to God's people and said, "God did not speak to me." That evangelist said, now you are on the right way. I thought to myself that they didn't know I had packed my suitcase to leave. Then he told me, "You have confessed the sins you remember, but there are many sins you have forgotten. Ask the Lord to remind you, and He will bring them to your memory."</p>

                  <p>I began praying again. As I was deep in prayer, I heard a loud noise, like a train passing over me. As this kept happening repeatedly, I was unable to move forward in prayer. Confused, I asked the evangelist why this was happening. Then he asked, "Have you ever traveled on a train without a ticket?" I was shocked by the question. In fact, I had once traveled from Ponnur to Tenali without a ticket. I immediately admitted it. He then instructed me, "Buy a ticket and tear it up as a sign of repentance."I obeyed and then returned to prayer. Suddenly, like a movie reel, my sins started playing before my eyes. I recalled how, during college, I used to eat for more days but write for fewer. The Lord was showing me everything so clearly that I began to cry. I confessed, "Lord, I am truly a thief." As God revealed every sin before my eyes, I realized that I had been justifying my actions according to the world. But in that moment, He gave me the understanding that everything I had done was unjust in His sight. Even though I was someone who never spoke inappropriately to girls, my thoughts and glances were impure. When God revealed this hidden truth, I began to weep even more.The Spirit of the Lord began to work mightily upon me. Without realizing it, I started crying loudly. I confessed and corrected all my sins. I made amends—some in person, some through money orders, and some through letters. In this way, my heart was cleansed. I even bought a train ticket and tore it to atone for traveling without one. From then on, I made it a habit to ask God for forgiveness for every sin, and He blessed me by helping me set things right.</p>

                  <p>Gradually, the joy of salvation filled my heart. Everything around me—every tree, every person—seemed new, as if I were seeing them for the first time. Even the smallest things in creation looked fresh and beautiful. My heart felt so light that, without realizing it, I began to leap with joy. I had never experienced such happiness in my life before. Whenever I saw someone, I would speak to them with tears in my eyes, warning them about their spiritual downfall. I would passionately explain their condition and share in detail how I had received the blessing of the Lord's salvation. Upon hearing my words, many began to weep, and in this way, the Lord was graciously using me to bring many to Him. I started spending hours in the Lord's presence—reading multiple chapters of the Bible and devoting quality time to prayer. This became a deep part of my life. Through this journey, I drew closer to the Lord and fully embraced the joy of salvation. The Lord spoke to me many times through visions and His Word, guiding me in even the smallest matters of life. He began to reveal His plans for me with great clarity.</p>

                  <p>One time, I lost my hotel ticket book. Since there was no name on it, anyone who found it could use it to eat. The second morning, I was deeply troubled. As I walked, I thought to myself, "Lord, I am very hungry. I have no patience to go to the hotel without my ticket book. Please provide me with food right now.” At that moment, evangelist approached me from behind, took my hand, and said, "Today is my daughter's birthday; you must eat with us." They took me to the gathering and prepared food for me along with everyone else. I praised the Lord for His provision.</p>

                  <p>That evening, as the sun was setting, I prayed with tears, "Lord, was there any disobedience in me that caused my ticket book to disappear? Please reveal it to me." Immediately, I felt the Lord speak to me: "Go for lunch, and I will return your tickets at the hotel." I got up and shared this with those around me. They were surprised but followed me to the hotel. After washing my hands, I sat down to eat. After finishing the meal, I washed my hands, wiped them, and stood in front of the hotel proprietor. Those who came with me stood aside, curiously watching what would happen. Time passed, yet I remained standing, believing that the Lord would fulfill His promise. Immediately, a doubt arose in my mind, and I looked at the phone next to me. "If they pressure me for payment, I will call to evangelist for help," I thought. Just as the proprietor was about to ask for money, I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, a man came running from inside. Proprietor and I were watching him . He approached me and asked, "Is this ticket book yours?" I said, "Yes, it's mine," and took it, the people with me excitedly ran around the hotel, rejoicing.When the proprietor asked, "What happened?" we explained the situation. We rejoiced and returned happily. At that moment, I marveled at the faithfulness of God. He had not only provided my meal but also returned what was lost, just as He had promised.</p>

                  <p>When God exposed these hidden flaws within me, I wept even more, realizing the depth of my wrongs. The Lord’s Spirit began to work powerfully within me, and I felt the weight of my past mistakes lifting as I came to terms with the reality of my actions. Unknowingly, I wept uncontrollably. I confessed every sin and sought to make amends for all wrongs. Personally and through letters, I asked for forgiveness from those I had wronged. In this manner, I began to realign my heart.</p>

                  <p>On one occasion, a farmer asked for prayer support to deal with a pest problem in his field. A prayer group was formed, and we went to his farm, where I was also a part of the group. The prayer leaders called on each person to pray individually, but I wasn't given the opportunity to pray. I didn't feel any anger or resentment towards the prayer leaders. In my heart, I simply wondered why God had not given me the chance to pray at that moment. Later, as we made our way back through the forest to the village, I stopped and prayed in solitude. I prayed, saying, "Lord, I believe You have been with me today. Through these two experiences, I ask You to strengthen me." Afterward, I went to the nearby temple in sorrow. It was there that the Lord spoke to me through His Word, saying, "All of you who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:26-29). This gave me a sense of comfort, and I felt God's presence more distinctly. The prayer leaders who were with me at the time also noticed the transformation in my spirit.</p>

                  <p>A fellow brother and I were sent to the center. As we walked, we discussed matters about God. That brother said to me, "Brother, these words you're speaking are not yours, but God is speaking through you." At that moment, my soul seemed to ascend into the heavens. My body and the brother were walking on the road, but my soul was up in the sky, looking down. I could see the streetlights of the market below. My body and the brother were moving through the street, while I walked in the heavens. After going some distance, my soul returned to my body. This experience greatly uplifted and encouraged me.</p>

                  <p>In another vision, I found myself standing at the Machilipatnam railway station. At the same station, the Lord was also standing and looked at me. As I gazed into His face, I heard the words, "Will you come to Madras?" Though His lips didn’t move, I was astonished and responded that I would come after settling a few minor matters within the year. The Lord looked at me, smiled, and went on His way. True enough, after a year, servants came from Madras. One of them asked me, "Are you the person the Lord spoke about? Will you come to Madras?" I was overjoyed, as the words spoken by the Lord a year earlier were firmly embedded in my heart. I replied that I had no objections and asked him to consult the servant here. They then sent me with a servant to Madras.</p>

                  <p>In Madras, God performed many mighty works. Even though I had been married for twelve years without children, a servant heard my testimony and asked me to pray for him to have children. I prayed in the name of Jesus, asking for the blessing of children. Some time later, as I was traveling back from Madras, that brother came to me and stopped me, saying, "You prayed for us, and now God has opened my wife's womb. Here is my wife." He insisted that I come to their house and accept their hospitality. Since they insisted, I couldn’t refuse, so I went with them and had a little meal. I was then taken to the Andhra people in Madras, where I preached the gospel. After the Holy Spirit worked powerfully, a hardened murderer was transformed. He wept, repented, and confessed his sins, which shocked the people who witnessed the change.</p>
